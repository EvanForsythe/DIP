# Divergence-based Introgression Polarization (DIP)

Introgressive hybridization is an impactful evolutionary process. 
While there are many tools for identifying the presence of introgression, few explicitly determine the direction in which genetic material was transferred during introgression.
DIP is a tool for polarizing both unidirectional and asymmetric bidirectional introgression to determine the donor and recipient taxa.
DIP works in a widely-used four-taxon context and is built to analyze either whole-chromosome alignments or single-locus alignments spanning the genome.
